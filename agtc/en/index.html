      <div class="content">
        <p>Hangeul type designs have continuously evolved since the 20th century. There has also been an increase in the types of discussions possible, such as new designs, techniques used for production, changes in the type market, and type design education. AG Type Conference (AGTC) is a meeting venue for holding professional discussions for those in the type design field, following current trends. The event, which is centered on working-level designers, will provide insights for the type industry, and create the type industry network.</p>

                  <p>We will explain the creating process of Superblack Myeongjo, and the difficulties and obstacles that came from designing thick buri type.</p>
                  <p>〈AG Superblack Myeongjo〉 is a digital type that was designed based on Black Myeongjo that was drawn for Hongik University's typography textbook 『Character Design (Ahn Sangsoo, 1986)』, as well as the title for the cover and inner pages of the magazine 『Madang』. As the original drawing for the letters of the type is not available in the design form, we started from collecting the letters used for the magazine 『Madang』 and its title. We would like to share our experience in researching about each stroke, and making the strokes for "Superblack Myeongjo" thicker to fit modern times.</p>
                  <p>While introducing the process of finding the evidence and roots of the form, we would also like to explain the evidence regarding how to make decisions based on the findings. We will talk about the use of space and structure for thicker strokes for Min buri type and other buri types, and what we considered when creating the Superblack Myeongjo including how to use the strokes for complex letters with many strokes.</p>

                  <p>Type has served as a supplement to text with messages, adding texture and atmosphere. Unlike lettering, it is applied to unspecified text, and the number or size of characters is not set in stone. Therefore, rather than giving the font a formative trait, a type designer focuses on making the letters easy to read even in various situations.</p>
                  <p>〈Climate Crisis Font〉 is a type created to deliver the message about the seriousness of climate crisis and the melting of glaciers is boldly expressed in the type. Rather than focusing on readability, the font focuses on showing the disappearing glaciers. The type aims to share the seriousness of climate crisis just by looking at the font. When 〈Climate Crisis Font〉 was turned into Hangeul, the focus was on refining the image of the melting and disappearing glaciers rather than enhancing the readability. We will join designer Noh Eunyou to go through the unique type working process that focused on not the readability but the formative traits.</p>

                  <small>Park Mingyu studied biosciences in university. However, after finding his love for design, he transferred to School of Visual Arts and majored in graphic design. Afterwards, Mingyu Park went to Paju typography Institute to complete the official program for Deobaegot, and after leaving AG Typography Institute, he is currently working as an independent type designer. His published types include 〈AG Choijeongho Minburi Std. Regular〉 developed at AG, and 〈Min Gothic〉, 〈Chulae〉, and 〈ParkMingyu〉.</small>

                  <p>After experiencing graphic design for the first time in the United States, a country that uses the Roman alphabet, Mingyu Park continued his studies at PaTI that uses Hangeul in the hope of learning more about typography. Unlike the Roman alphabet that Mingyu Park was familiar with, using Hangeul type was quite awkward, and so this caused him to make his own Hangeul type. To make sure that no other type is considered, the type started from his own handwriting. After trial and error, 〈Min Gothic〉 came forth into the world.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards, Park Mingyu started to work again on 〈ParkMingyu〉 that became the start of 〈Min Gothic〉, improving upon existing issues. When 〈ParkMingyu〉 was almost finished, he found a Roman character type that seemed new from the book 『Theory of Type Design』. In hopes of making a Hangeul type that is also similar, he added curves to the foundation of 〈ParkMingyu〉 and edited the structure to make 〈ParkMingyu〉's family type, 〈Chulae〉.</p>
                  <p>With a passion to make better type, he looked for clues from old characters. After research, Park Mingyu found 〈typeface for national textbooks⟩, and based on this foundation, he is currently working on a new type.</p>

                  <p>OpenType is a font format that saves the path information based on the bezier curve. Since it was first introduced in 1996, the format has been used for a number of computer platforms. OpenType feature allows for the combination of letters, kerning, and other editing functions. This is what makes OpenType important for not only technicians but also designers.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, OpenType is a terminology that you relatively commonly come across if you design or work with types. However, only a few designers can accurately understand and use OpenType.</p>

This presentation will allow the audience to understand not only the path information, but also the types of meta information that can be saved on OpenType and how to save them, and the processing methods of the OpenType feature.</p>

                  <p>Although there are a number of programs to create types, only a few are specialized to develop Hangeul types. Most of them are centered on Latin, so there is only a little bit of support for letters other than Latin. Glyphs has a function just for Hangeul including the "Hangeul Combination Group," and also has various convenient functions such as smart component and multiple master. In addition, another strength of Glyphs is that external programmers can develop and provide new functions as a plug-in. It will be possible to create more creative new types in the future in an environment with such a great program.</p>
